    question: "Tell me about yourself?",
    answer: "This is something you'll be asked a lot at the beginning of an interview. Here are three tips that'll help you nail the opener. Be succinct, honest and engaging.I call this the “SHE” formula. Resist the urge to give a detailed account of the last two decades of your career. The interviewer is looking for an answer that shows them you're qualified and can respond to an unstructured question. Use the job description to prepare. Reread what they want and highlight the most required skills that you have. Are they looking for someone who can solve problems or deal with tough customers? Pick a few and brainstorm how you can describe yourself while showcasing your strengths for what they’re seeking. Tie your story to their needs. People love a good tale, so weave in some personality. For example, maybe you fell in love with the hospitality industry because your grandparents ran a bed and breakfast. Connect your story back to the job, keep it short, and be truthful."

    question: "What is your greatest strength?",
    answer: "When responding to this question, you want to sound humble and not like you’re arrogant or bragging. Here are some tips to help you give them a great answer.Describe a relevant experience.If you're applying for a sales job, tell a story about a time where you helped a customer solve a problem with your solution.Give specific details.Tell them about a time you closed a deal that helped you hit a percentage of your annual number. When you share those facts with them, it helps them visualise how effective you have been.Show them you’re a well-rounded person.For example, share a story of when you used a “soft” skill, like effective communication with a coworker, and then one about you using a technical skill, which could be anything asked for in the job description."

    id: 3,
    question: "What is your greatest weakness?",
    answer: "This can feel like a tricky question, but it’s a good opportunity to shine. Here are some tips on how to answer: Be humble. You want to communicate an authentic story that shows you're self-aware. It's okay that you don't come off as perfect, that's authentic, which is important for someone who will have to trust you in the role that they're hiring for. Choose a trait that is not too relevant to the job. For example, if you're applying for a project manager role, choose a weakness that is more related to creativity, which is something that doesn't disqualify you from the description of the things that would make someone successful in that role Show how you manage it. Have a fix-it strategy. For example, if you struggle with remembering product details so you track them in their phone or side notebook, that's okay, share that with them. That shows that you've got commitment to solving that problem and addressing it."

    id: 4,
    question: "Why should we hire you?",
    answer: "This is a nerve-racking question, so make sure you're set up for success. Here are some tips that can help you do well in answering it: Ask yourself why you think you’re qualified. Prepare for the interview by picking three or four qualifications and experiences that help them understand why you're a fit for this job.  Tell them how you’d fit in. Paint a picture of what you’d accomplish that gives you a leg up on the competition. Also, show them why you are a great match for this company by letting them see that you know about their mission, their vision, how they operate—and how you would fit into that really well. Speak authentically. How you say something is as important as what you say. So when you're sharing your successes and you're answering these questions, speak like the best version of yourself and make sure that you're doing it in a way that allows the interviewers to connect to you."

    question: "Why do you want to work here?",
    answer: "You would be amazed by how few people get this question right. So you've got a big opportunity to shine. Make it all about them. Your best answer will be about what they need. It'll show that you've done your research and have thought through what you can contribute to that team. Show them how you can help. Weave your story into the context of what you can contribute. If you have strong accounting skills and are interviewing for a finance role at a humane society, you could suggest that this job would allow you to blend your professional skills with your passion for animals. Speak from the heart. Telling a genuine story can make a big difference. For example, I once worked with a client who was applying for a zoo event manager job and she had grown up next door to that zoo and had great memories of the peacocks flying over the fence and sitting on her dad's car. So her answer was that she wanted people to have fun memories of that zoo just like she did. Try to top that."

    id: 6,
    question: "Tell me about a time you were successful on a team?",
    answer: "Respond to this kind of question with a compelling story that uses the \"SAR\" framework: situation, action, and results. Describe the situation. Talk about the initial events that occurred. What were the problems that you were experiencing? What needed to be solved and what resources did you have--or not have? This is a really key part of the story, so it should be about three to four sentences long. Get into the action. Speak about the key milestones that you went through. Tell them what you did to turn the situation around. Don't go into too much detail though. It should only be about two to three sentences, and try to use active verbs, things like “I implemented” or “I persuaded”. Show the results. Let them know how well things turned out, how the problems were solved and what you may have learned along the way. Try to include a clincher at the end, like dollars saved or improved profitability. It drives home that you did a great thing."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "What would you co-workers say about you?",
    answer: "This question gives you an opportunity to share how amazing you are—without feeling like you're showboating. Here are three quick tips on how to answer it: Find features that fit. Re-read the job description and look for answers that go well with it. For example, if they need a strong problem solver, maybe you can share that your office nickname is “The Fixer” because you're so good at solving tough challenges. Share some of your reviews. Before the interview, go through your LinkedIn recommendations and performance reviews and see if there are some gold nuggets you might want to show them. And if it's on LinkedIn, mention it to the interviewers so they can read the whole recommendation if they want more detail. Back it up with evidence. If you think your colleagues would say that you're super creative, resist the urge to say “People like that I can think outside of the box”. Instead, share a tangible example of your creativity that ties to the job description."

    id: 8,
    question: "Do you have any questions for me?",
    answer: "The way you respond to this question shows employers if you're engaged, intelligent and interested. Here are some tips on how to answer: Show them you’re paying attention. It’s important to let them know you’ve been listening.You may want to take notes as the interview unfolds and then loop back to something you'd like to delve further into like an aspect of the job, the team, or the challenges that lie ahead. Let them know you’re excited. While being qualified for the job is essential, showing passion for their products, brand or industry takes it to the next level. So maybe you can ask a question about one of your favorite products they make or see how they're responding to an industry trend. Get them talking about their careers. People love talking about themselves and appreciate when you notice the interesting things they're doing. For example, you can ask them how they got from Job X to Job Y, or how their work as a musician helped them in their current career. People hire people that they like and who seem genuinely interested in the role."

    id: 10,
    question: "If we want to return the character from a specific index which method is used?",
    answer: "The JavaScript string charAt() method is used to find out a char value present at the specified index. The index number starts from 0 and goes to n-1, where n is the length of the string. The index value can't be a negative, greater than or equal to the length of the string."

    id: 11,
    question: "Explain what the useState Hook is used for in React?",
    answer: "useState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value."

    id: 12,
    question: "When should you use Object Oriented Programming?",
    answer: "whenever you're going to being creating more than one or two of an item that has some shared properties and some unique ones."
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    question: "What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?",
    answer: "Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later."
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    question: "What is the difference between relational and non-relational databases?",
    answer: "A relational database is structured, meaning the data is organized in tables. Many times, the data within these tables have relationships with one another, or dependencies. A non relational database is document-oriented, meaning, all information gets stored in more of a laundry list order. Within a single construct, or document, you will have all of your data listed out."
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    question: "Explain the differences between lo-fi and hi-fi wireframes?",
    answer: "Lo-fi wireframe will present as a basic illustration of a product's intended layout and user journeys. On the other hand, a hi-fi design will look as close to the finished product as is possible within the limitations of the design tool that is being used."
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    question: "What is an API?",
    answer: "An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. In other words, an API is the messenger that delivers your request to the provider that you’re requesting it from and then delivers the response back to you. "
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    question: "When should code be refactored?",
    answer: "Refactoring can be performed after a product has been deployed, before adding updates and new features to existing code, or as a part of day-to-day programming. When the process is performed after deployment, it is normally done before developers move on to the next project. An organization may be able to refactor more code at this point in the software delivery lifecycle, where the developers have increased availability and more time to work on the source code changes needed."
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    question: "What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions?",
    answer: "Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another. Tasks can run simultaneously. Synchronous is a blocking architecture, so the execution of each operation is dependent on the completion of the one before it."
  },
  {
    id: 19,
    question: "What is JSX in React?",
    answer: "JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. By using JSX, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code."
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    question: "What is the Virtual DOM in React?",
    answer: "React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM. When the state of an object changes, virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects."
  },
  {
    id: 21,
    question: "What is meant by test coverage?",
    answer: "Test coverage is a quality metric to represent the amount (in percentage) of testing completed for a product. It is relevant for both functional and non-functional testing activities. This metric is used to add missing test cases."
  },
  {
    id: 22,
    question: "What is the purpose of the end-to-end testing?",
    answer: "End-to-end testing is a testing strategy to execute tests that cover every possible flow of an application from its start to finish. The objective of performing end-to-end tests is to discover software dependencies and to assert that the correct input is getting passed between various software modules and sub-systems."
